# Mario's Rivet Graph Repository (RGR)
Some useful Rivet Graphs I've built to do stuff


## Graphs

* clean_json: Parses code block or otherwise malformed json code and attempts to return a valid json object.

* config_loader: Given a path to a file in 'dotenv' format, read variables and set them as globals.

* run_python_code: Executes input python script and prints "result" variable, returns output. (UNSAFE - Requires 'Node' runner and Python plugin)
