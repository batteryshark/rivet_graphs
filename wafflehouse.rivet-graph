          Pull-Drop-Mark System Simplified Guide for Employees


          Pull: 

          - **Meats**: Pull the specified meat from the refrigerator onto the grill. "Pull one bacon" means three strips of bacon.

          - **Special Orders**: For rare or medium-rare steaks, specify at this time. Otherwise, meat doneness and other specifics are marked later.

          - **Sausage Sandwiches**: Call it "sausage for a sandwich" to prepare a larger patty.


          Drop: 

          - **Hashbrowns**: State the number of hashbrowns, indicating if they're scattered or in the ring.
            - "Drop three hashbrowns scattered" for outside the ring.
            - If any are in the ring, specify the number, e.g., "Drop three hashbrowns, one in the ring."
          - **Cooking Preferences**: Include if hashbrowns are "scattered well" or "light". For "steamed" hashbrowns, expect a half-full glass of ice for preparation.


          Mark: 

          - **Sandwiches**: Use physical markers to indicate types and specifics of sandwiches. A piece of ham marks bacon additions; a pickle and onion piece(s) mark originals and doubles.

          - **Waffles, Wraps, Melts**:
            - Wraps are marked like their sandwich counterparts, adding a tortilla.
            - Melts include grilled bread, cheese (except breakfast sandwiches), and onions if applicable. Mark with the appropriate meat and bread type.
          - **Hashbrown Toppings**: Specify toppings and any extra instructions during the mark phase.

          - **Unique Orders**: For items with specific preparation methods (e.g., deluxe setups, originals), follow unique marking guidelines provided.

          hello my name is Greg Hall today we're
          going to discuss the pull drop mark
          calling system this system is the only
          approved method for calling in marking
          and preparing food at Waffle House the
          pull drop mark Collin system is made up
          of three basic steps the pull the drop
          and the mark
          [Music]
          well 1/4 the poll refers to the number
          and type of meats to be cooked
          pull one bacon for example when instruct
          the grill operator to pull three strips
          of bacon from the refrigerator and place
          it on the grill notice that I said one
          bacon and not a bacon you must always
          use an exact number these numbers refer
          to the number of orders to be cooked and
          not necessarily the number of pieces of
          meat while you pull one t-bone when pull
          one t-bone is called you would pull two
          pieces of pork chop
          when pull one porkchop is called because
          one order of pork chops is actually two
          chops how well a steak is prepared does
          not need to be called in at this time
          unless that steak is rare or medium-rare
          the cooking instructions will come later
          in the call in during the mark grill
          operators go ahead and season all red
          meats before you move on to the next
          step one final thing to remember for the
          pull if you have a sausage sandwich
          it must be called in sausage for a
          sandwich so that the two patties can be
          pressed together to form a large sausage
          sandwich patty
          [Music]
          one hashbrown scattered once a
          salesperson has visually verified that
          all the meats have been pulled to the
          grill or to a plate on top of the cooks
          board they will say drop to specify how
          many scoops of hashbrowns to put on the
          grill and whether they are scattered or
          in the ring don't worry about any
          toppings that go into the hashbrowns
          whether they're double or triple at this
          point that will come later in the mark
          if all the hashbrowns are in the ring
          the salesperson will say drop three
          hashbrowns in the ring if none of the
          hashbrowns are in the ring they'll say
          drop three hashbrowns scattered if some
          are in the ring and some are scattered
          they'll only tell you the number that
          are in the ring for example if they need
          three hashbrowns and one is in the ring
          they'll say drop three hashbrowns one in
          the ring the drop is also a time where
          the salesperson can let you know if the
          customer wants the hashbrowns scattered
          well or scattered light so a sales
          person may say drop one hashbrowns
          scattered well and this lets you know
          that the customer wants their hashbrowns
          cooked well they may also ask you to
          drop one hashbrowns steam in that case
          the sales person will bring you
          half-full glass of ice and you'll
          prepare those hashbrowns steamed under
          the dome according to the Waffle House
          Way
          [Music]
          mark Texas patty melt plate scattered
          mother covered and peppered once a
          salesperson has visually confirmed that
          the meats have been pulled to the grill
          and hash browns have been dropped they
          will call in the full order this is
          called the mark it is at this point that
          the sales person will call all the
          details of the order into you including
          how steaks are to be cooked which hash
          browns will be doubles or triples and
          also any toppings that will go into the
          hash browns this is where the magic
          marker system begins as the sales person
          calls in the order it is your job to
          begin placing markers on the plates
          using the special code that Waffle House
          has designed to help you remember
          exactly how everything is to be prepared
          we call the system magic because our
          customers often do not notice the
          markers on the plates and think you have
          memorized all of the orders that were
          being called in in reality you're just
          using our code to mark the orders so
          that you can read the plates and get
          orders prepared quickly and accurately
          every time
          Texas patty melt plate scattered
          smothered covered and pepper thank you
          now that you've got the marks on the
          plates it's time for one last step in
          the pulled drop mark system the callback
          the salesperson will be watching you as
          you Martin the plates and also waiting
          for you to call back the order to make
          sure you've got it exactly right don't
          keep them waiting call back the order to
          them as soon as you get it marked so
          that they can get back to taking care of
          the customer and you can get back to
          cooking the food okay now that you

          understand the basics of the pull drop
          mark system I'll talk you through the
          most common marks and show you how to
          mark
          [Music]
          Waffle House is one of the world's
          leading server of eggs so why don't we
          talk about them first all of our egg
          breakfasts are automatically served with
          grits and white toast a customer may
          choose to have a biscuit or possibly
          wheat raisin or Texas toast instead and
          can also substitute hashbrowns sliced
          tomatoes or oatmeal for the grits let's
          start off by marking an order scramble
          simply place a right-side-up jelly pack
          vertically in the bottom position of the
          plate the jelly pack represents two eggs
          which we call an order and the location
          of the plate tells us that they are
          scrambled with the plate marked like
          this the customer is getting an order of
          scrambled eggs with white toast in grits
          if the customer would rather have
          hashbrowns you simply add a few shreds
          of hash browns to the plate for tomatoes
          instead of grits simply add a slice of
          tomato and for oatmeal instead of grits
          simply add a napkin
          with a brown sugar pack on top of it if
          a customer wants their grits to be
          served in a bowl you would indicate that
          by placing a napkin on the plate as all
          bowls on a plate must be served with a
          napkin underneath to prevent sliding in
          this order if the customer wants wheat
          toast
          we simply flip the jelly pack over to
          indicate wheat we use a pack of apple
          butter if the customer wants raisin
          toast if the customer wants a slice of

          Texas toast or a biscuit instead mark
          the eggs with a jelly pack and place a
          slice of Texas toast or a biscuit on the
          plate to remind you that they prefer to
          have Texas toast or a biscuit instead
          some folks like to have their toast
          unbuttered or dry in this case we have a
          special mark to remind us to hold the
          butter easily enough it's a butter
          packet underneath the jelly packet like
          this so what if a customer wants double
          toast easy mark the eggs and then put an
          additional jelly pack beside the egg
          marker to indicate the extra order of
          toast like this now that we've learned
          some of the basics for marking eggs
          let's look at some other
          to keep in mind when marking egg orders
          while most customers order two eggs
          occasionally a customer may only want a
          single egg in that case we'll mark the
          egg in the appropriate position to show
          how the egg is cooked and then placed a
          ketchup pack below it in that case we'll
          mark the egg in the appropriate position
          to show how the egg is cooked and then
          place a ketchup packet here you can see
          that I've marked a single over light
          breakfast in other cases a customer may
          be hungry and might want three eggs to
          mark a triple you'll mark the eggs with
          the jelly pack in the appropriate
          position and include a mustard pack
          below the jelly pack here's an example

          of how to mark a triple scramble if the
          jelly pack indicates two eggs and how
          might you mark the plate if a customer
          wants four eggs that's right
          you use two jelly pack stacked on top of
          each other like this here's the mark
          four four over medium one of those
          popular ways to have eggs at the Waffle
          House is scrambled so let's talk about
          different ways to mark scrambled eggs
          the mark for our signature scrambled
          eggs with cheese is simple first mark
          the eggs as scrambled like this and then
          simply add slices of cheese it is
          important to remember that the customer
          gets one slice of cheese for each egg so
          if the customer wants two eggs they get
          two slices of cheese to make this a
          triple scramble cheese you add the
          mustard pack below the jelly pack to
          make it a triple and add a third slice
          of cheese you also want to tear off a

          small corner of the cheese and place it
          on the top of the marker to help you
          remember that it comes with cheese if a
          customer wants their egg scramble light
          so they're a little runny mark the
          scrambled eggs and include an
          upside-down Mayo pack to indicate light
          and remember to remove the marker before
          you take the plate to the customer
          well eggs are similar only you turn the
          Mayo pack right-side up to show that
          they want the scrambled eggs to be
          cooked well next we'll look at how to

          mark over light over medium and over
          well eggs no Dover light is marked with
          the jelly pack on the left side of the
          plate like this an order over medium is
          logically right in the middle of the
          plate and an order of a well is all the
          way to the right side of the plate
          notice that the level of doneness for
          the eggs increases from left to right
          let's look at the last few types of eggs
          available for the waffle house we refer
          to sunny-side up eggs simply as up and
          mark them by placing the marker up on
          the top of the plate like this
          occasionally a customer may ask for
          their eggs to be basted which means
          they're partially cooked on the grill
          the mark for this is here just below the
          up egg position poached eggs are another
          less common order and these eggs are
          made by cooking the egg whites and yolks
          in boiling water the mark propos'd is
          between the scrambled and over-medium
          positions sometimes a customer may not
          want the toast grits or anything else
          other than their eggs these options are
          very easy to mark here I'll mark an

          order over well hold the grits notice

          that I used a nine-inch waffle plate but
          still mark the eggs the same way as if
          it were on a platter this slightly
          smaller plate is a visual reminder that
          the customer doesn't want grits can you
          guess how to mark those same over weigh
          legs on the side that's right you'd use
          the same marker only you'd place it on a
          small plate to remind you that they do
          not want toast or grits finally if a
          customer wants to hold the toast you
          simply place a butter knife on the plate

          these rules for hold the grits hold the
          toast and on the side apply to all egg
          orders including omelets you may have
          asked yourself why I made sure to keep
          the jelly packs vertical when marking
          the egg breakfast that's because if I
          turn the pack horizontally like this it
          means that this is now the mark for an
          omelet there are four positions on the
          plate to mark an omelet ham sausage
          bacon and plain I'm going to show you an
          easy way to remember them a horizontal
          pack in the number one position here at
          the top of the plate represents ham you
          can remember ham is number one because a
          side order of ham comes with one slice a
          packet here on the right side in the
          number two position is a sausage omelet
          - sausage patties come per order and the
          marker is in the number two position the
          number three position is used to mark a
          bacon omelet three strips in an order
          and a mark in the number three position
          the plain position is the only one left
          and it's in the number four position
          here on the left side of the plate
          examples of omelettes that have a mark
          in the number four position could be
          omelets with no meat in them such as
          cheese omelet or a mushroom omelet these
          are marked using a horizontal jelly
          packet in the number four position and a
          piece of the corresponding ingredient
          here you can see a cheese omelet also
          the Fiesta omelet which is indicated by
          a horizontal jelly pack with a right
          side up salad dressing
          pack underneath and a cheese steak

          omelet which is marked with the right
          side up ketchup packet two slices of
          cheese and a jelly pack in the number
          four position
          [Music]

          waffles are our namesake so of course we
          need to learn how to mark them correctly
          a regular waffle is marked using a
          right-side up buttercup on the cooks
          board to mark a pecan waffle simply turn
          the Buttercup over like this chocolate
          chip waffles are another favorite and
          are easy to mark simply mark a regular
          waffle and place a few pieces of
          chocolate chip on top of the marker
          sometimes a customer wants their waffle
          lighter dark so we need to mark them
          accordingly we marked the light and the
          dark waffles the same way we marked the
          light or well scrambled eggs using an
          upside-down Mayo pack for light and a
          right side up Mayo pack for dark looking
          at the pack may help you remember which
          is light and which is dark notice the
          upside down has no text and is lighter
          in color the label side looks darker
          because of the text on it for those
          hungry customers we offer a double
          waffle which is marked by stacking the
          butter cups on top of each other like
          this finally if a sales person calls in
          a waffle to go use it to go syrup packet
          to remind you that it goes in it to go
          play
          [Music]

          now let's talk about our breakfast
          sandwiches just like omelettes these
          sandwiches have the same four positions
          ham sausage bacon and plain to mark a

          sandwich place to pickle slices in the
          appropriate position here you can see I
          put two pickle slices in the number
          three position which tells me this is a
          bacon sandwich if I add a slice of
          cheese to the plate I know this is a
          bacon cheese sandwich to make this a
          bacon egg and cheese sandwich I'll add
          this right side up Mayo packet to the
          right side of the plate
          don't let this Mayo pack confuse you as
          long as you see two pickles on the plate
          you know this is a sandwich when marking
          a sandwich
          this Mayo pack and pickles means a
          sandwich with eggs
          if a customer wanted the eggs on their
          sandwich to be scrambled instead of the
          standard over well egg I'd move this
          Mayo pack down to the bottom of the
          plate to show that the egg is scrambled
          so how would a market if the customer
          wanted an egg and cheese sandwich that's
          right I would put two pickles in the
          plain position to show that there's no
          meat add the slice of cheese and put the
          Mayo pack here on the right side to show
          that the egg is cooked over well what if
          the customer wants to have a sandwich on
          a biscuit or Texas toast the Mart
          remains the same but you must include
          the biscuit or Texas toast to let us

          know the customer doesn't want it served
          on the standard toast the last thing I
          want to cover with sandwiches is the
          mark 4 deluxe sometimes a customer wants
          to add lettuce tomato or grilled onions
          to a sandwich that doesn't automatically
          come with them we call that sandwich
          deluxe let's say that the customer wants
          an egg cheese sandwich with lettuce
          tomato and grilled onions the
          salesperson would call in mark egg
          cheese deluxe and you would mark it with
          two pickles in the plain position a Mayo
          pack to indicate the egg and a slice of
          cheese a leaf of lettuce a slice of
          tomato and a piece of diced onion what

          the customer didn't want the grilled
          onions on this sandwich easy
          the salesperson would call in Mart egg
          cheese deluxe hold the onion and you
          would mark it the same way except you
          would not put the piece of onion on the
          plate many of our customers will want

          bad hashbrowns to these sandwiches so
          let's cover the basic markers for our
          signature waffles hashbrowns to make an
          item a plate which includes hashbrowns
          you simply add a few shreds of
          hashbrowns only platter with the marker
          here I'll mark a bacon egg cheese plate

          if a customer wants a single hash brown
          on the side place a few shreds of hash
          browns on the plate a double hash brown
          goes on a waffle plate and a triple hash
          brown will go on a platter if a customer
          wants ingredients such as onions added
          to the hashbrowns simply add a piece of
          the add-on to the shreds of hashbrowns
          like this
          steamed hash browns are marked by adding
          a butter cup to the shreds of the hash
          browns and a hash brown all the way is
          marked by adding a right-side up
          dressing pack to the shred of hashbrowns

          now that we've covered most of our
          breakfast items let's move on to our
          dinners and major meat sandwiches all
          major meat dinners automatically come
          with hash browns and a piece of grilled
          Texas toast our major meat and egg
          dinners also automatically come with
          hash browns but they include eggs and
          white toast our steak meals require a
          little extra work when marking because
          we will show how well the customer wants
          their steak cooked by where we place the
          marker on the plate t-bone dinner medium
          for instance is marked with the right
          side up buttercup in the middle of the
          plate and a few shreds of hash browns
          how well the steak is cooked increases
          the further up the plates you go so the
          bottom of the plate is rare then up to
          medium rare medium medium-well
          and finally well done you don't have to
          worry about positioning for chicken pork
          chop and country ham as these are always
          cooked well done major meats and eggs
          are marked the same as the corresponding
          dinner
          except you must remember to mark the
          eggs and toast here for example is
          t-bone and eggs well done and over
          medium wheat we just learned that a

          t-bone is marked with the right side up
          buttercup
          but if we flip the Buttercup over we now
          have the mark for a ribeye let's look at
          the mustard Pat the right side up this
          mustard pack represents pork chops while
          upside down we've marked country ham a
          right side up
          ketchup pack is used to mark a sirloin
          dinner
          mayonnaise packs represents a quarter
          pound hamburger when right side up and
          chicken went upside down there are two

          ways that a customer might add some
          great flavor to their dinner or major
          meat and eggs and that is by making them
          southern classic or country classic
          southern classic meals are marked using
          the normal marker and adding an
          upside-down dressing packet
          country classic is easy as all you have
          to do is place a piece of mushroom and
          diced onion with the mark to remind you
          to add onions and mushrooms with the
          meat next I want to talk about our major
          meat sandwiches probably the most common
          major meat sandwich is our quarter pound
          hamburger which we simply call quarter
          quarters and all major meat sandwiches
          come to luxe and should be marked the
          same way we discussed earlier here I'll
          show you how to mark a quarter deluxe
          the marker is a right side up mayo pack
          with lettuce tomato and a piece of onion
          the chicken sandwich is another popular
          menu item simply flip the Mayo pack
          upside down and include deluxe items if

          I switched out the Mayo pack for a
          right-side up mustard pack we would have
          a pork chop sandwich if we turn that
          pack over like this we have the mark for
          a country ham sandwich a ketchup pack
          with deluxe setup lets us know that we
          have a sirloin sandwich customers will
          often want to add bacon to their major
          meat sandwiches if this is the case a
          half order of bacon is included on the
          sandwich and the plate is to be marked
          with a piece of chunked ham to represent
          the bacon here you can see a bacon
          quarter cheese deluxe originals are

          great little burgers with their own
          special way of preparation and marking
          as they are not handled like major meat
          sandwiches an original is marked with a
          single pickle in the center of the plate
          with a piece of onion on top of it if a
          customer wants two patties the mark for
          a double original would include one
          pickle and two pieces of onion like this
          [Music]

          the final items we'll cover today are
          waffles wraps and melts all sandwiches
          can be served as a wrap and are marked
          exactly as they would be for the
          corresponding sandwich you simply add a
          tortilla to the plate here's the mark
          for a sausage egg cheese wrap notice the

          egg marker is in the scramble position
          because all wraps include scrambled eggs
          a melt is a sandwich that is served with
          grilled bread two slices of cheese and
          grilled onions such as a patty Mountain
          breakfast sandwiches can be served as
          melts but they do not include onions to
          mark them out
          simply place the appropriate mark for
          the meat and include the type of bread
          to be grilled in the slices of cheese
          with the mark here I'll mark a Texas
          cheesesteak sandwich with the right side
          up ketchup pack two slices of cheese and
          two pieces of Texas toast well that's
          all for today remember we didn't cover
          every single mark that exists so if you
          are unsure about any of the marks always
          consult the Waffle House Way and always
          wear gloves when handling ready-to-eat
          foods such as many of our markers the
          pull drop mark system is not only
          mandatory here at the Waffle House it is
          also a proven method for reducing stress
          in the restaurant and providing
          consistent delicious food for all of our
          customers

          hello my name is Greg Hall today we're
          going to discuss the pull drop mark
          calling system this system is the only
          approved method for calling in marking
          and preparing food at Waffle House the
          pull drop mark Collin system is made up
          of three basic steps the pull the drop
          and the mark
          [Music]
          well 1/4 the poll refers to the number
          and type of meats to be cooked
          pull one bacon for example when instruct
          the grill operator to pull three strips
          of bacon from the refrigerator and place
          it on the grill notice that I said one
          bacon and not a bacon you must always
          use an exact number these numbers refer
          to the number of orders to be cooked and
          not necessarily the number of pieces of
          meat while you pull one t-bone when pull
          one t-bone is called you would pull two
          pieces of pork chop
          when pull one porkchop is called because
          one order of pork chops is actually two
          chops how well a steak is prepared does
          not need to be called in at this time
          unless that steak is rare or medium-rare
          the cooking instructions will come later
          in the call in during the mark grill
          operators go ahead and season all red
          meats before you move on to the next
          step one final thing to remember for the
          pull if you have a sausage sandwich
          it must be called in sausage for a
          sandwich so that the two patties can be
          pressed together to form a large sausage
          sandwich patty

          one hashbrown scattered once a
          salesperson has visually verified that
          all the meats have been pulled to the
          grill or to a plate on top of the cooks
          board they will say drop to specify how
          many scoops of hashbrowns to put on the
          grill and whether they are scattered or
          in the ring don't worry about any
          toppings that go into the hashbrowns
          whether they're double or triple at this
          point that will come later in the mark
          if all the hashbrowns are in the ring
          the salesperson will say drop three
          hashbrowns in the ring if none of the
          hashbrowns are in the ring they'll say
          drop three hashbrowns scattered if some
          are in the ring and some are scattered
          they'll only tell you the number that
          are in the ring for example if they need
          three hashbrowns and one is in the ring
          they'll say drop three hashbrowns one in
          the ring the drop is also a time where
          the salesperson can let you know if the
          customer wants the hashbrowns scattered
          well or scattered light so a sales
          person may say drop one hashbrowns
          scattered well and this lets you know
          that the customer wants their hashbrowns
          cooked well they may also ask you to
          drop one hashbrowns steam in that case
          the sales person will bring you
          half-full glass of ice and you'll
          prepare those hashbrowns steamed under
          the dome according to the Waffle House
          Way

          mark Texas patty melt plate scattered
          mother covered and peppered once a
          salesperson has visually confirmed that
          the meats have been pulled to the grill
          and hash browns have been dropped they
          will call in the full order this is
          called the mark it is at this point that
          the sales person will call all the
          details of the order into you including
          how steaks are to be cooked which hash
          browns will be doubles or triples and
          also any toppings that will go into the
          hash browns this is where the magic
          marker system begins as the sales person
          calls in the order it is your job to
          begin placing markers on the plates
          using the special code that Waffle House
          has designed to help you remember
          exactly how everything is to be prepared
          we call the system magic because our
          customers often do not notice the
          markers on the plates and think you have
          memorized all of the orders that were
          being called in in reality you're just
          using our code to mark the orders so
          that you can read the plates and get
          orders prepared quickly and accurately
          every time
          Texas patty melt plate scattered
          smothered covered and pepper thank you
          now that you've got the marks on the
          plates it's time for one last step in
          the pulled drop mark system the callback
          the salesperson will be watching you as
          you Martin the plates and also waiting
          for you to call back the order to make
          sure you've got it exactly right don't
          keep them waiting call back the order to
          them as soon as you get it marked so
          that they can get back to taking care of
          the customer and you can get back to
          cooking the food okay now that you

          understand the basics of the pull drop
          mark system I'll talk you through the
          most common marks and show you how to
          mark

          Waffle House is one of the world's
          leading server of eggs so why don't we
          talk about them first all of our egg
          breakfasts are automatically served with
          grits and white toast a customer may
          choose to have a biscuit or possibly
          wheat raisin or Texas toast instead and
          can also substitute hashbrowns sliced
          tomatoes or oatmeal for the grits let's
          start off by marking an order scramble
          simply place a right-side-up jelly pack
          vertically in the bottom position of the
          plate the jelly pack represents two eggs
          which we call an order and the location
          of the plate tells us that they are
          scrambled with the plate marked like
          this the customer is getting an order of
          scrambled eggs with white toast in grits
          if the customer would rather have
          hashbrowns you simply add a few shreds
          of hash browns to the plate for tomatoes
          instead of grits simply add a slice of
          tomato and for oatmeal instead of grits
          simply add a napkin
          with a brown sugar pack on top of it if
          a customer wants their grits to be
          served in a bowl you would indicate that
          by placing a napkin on the plate as all
          bowls on a plate must be served with a
          napkin underneath to prevent sliding in
          this order if the customer wants wheat
          toast
          we simply flip the jelly pack over to
          indicate wheat we use a pack of apple
          butter if the customer wants raisin
          toast if the customer wants a slice of

          Texas toast or a biscuit instead mark
          the eggs with a jelly pack and place a
          slice of Texas toast or a biscuit on the
          plate to remind you that they prefer to
          have Texas toast or a biscuit instead
          some folks like to have their toast
          unbuttered or dry in this case we have a
          special mark to remind us to hold the
          butter easily enough it's a butter
          packet underneath the jelly packet like
          this so what if a customer wants double
          toast easy mark the eggs and then put an
          additional jelly pack beside the egg
          marker to indicate the extra order of
          toast like this now that we've learned
          some of the basics for marking eggs
          let's look at some other
          to keep in mind when marking egg orders
          while most customers order two eggs
          occasionally a customer may only want a
          single egg in that case we'll mark the
          egg in the appropriate position to show
          how the egg is cooked and then placed a
          ketchup pack below it in that case we'll
          mark the egg in the appropriate position
          to show how the egg is cooked and then
          place a ketchup packet here you can see
          that I've marked a single over light
          breakfast in other cases a customer may
          be hungry and might want three eggs to
          mark a triple you'll mark the eggs with
          the jelly pack in the appropriate
          position and include a mustard pack
          below the jelly pack here's an example

          of how to mark a triple scramble if the
          jelly pack indicates two eggs and how
          might you mark the plate if a customer
          wants four eggs that's right
          you use two jelly pack stacked on top of
          each other like this here's the mark
          four four over medium one of those
          popular ways to have eggs at the Waffle
          House is scrambled so let's talk about
          different ways to mark scrambled eggs
          the mark for our signature scrambled
          eggs with cheese is simple first mark
          the eggs as scrambled like this and then
          simply add slices of cheese it is
          important to remember that the customer
          gets one slice of cheese for each egg so
          if the customer wants two eggs they get
          two slices of cheese to make this a
          triple scramble cheese you add the
          mustard pack below the jelly pack to
          make it a triple and add a third slice
          of cheese you also want to tear off a

          small corner of the cheese and place it
          on the top of the marker to help you
          remember that it comes with cheese if a
          customer wants their egg scramble light
          so they're a little runny mark the
          scrambled eggs and include an
          upside-down Mayo pack to indicate light
          and remember to remove the marker before
          you take the plate to the customer
          well eggs are similar only you turn the
          Mayo pack right-side up to show that
          they want the scrambled eggs to be
          cooked well next we'll look at how to

          mark over light over medium and over
          well eggs no Dover light is marked with
          the jelly pack on the left side of the
          plate like this an order over medium is
          logically right in the middle of the
          plate and an order of a well is all the
          way to the right side of the plate
          notice that the level of doneness for
          the eggs increases from left to right
          let's look at the last few types of eggs
          available for the waffle house we refer
          to sunny-side up eggs simply as up and
          mark them by placing the marker up on
          the top of the plate like this
          occasionally a customer may ask for
          their eggs to be basted which means
          they're partially cooked on the grill
          the mark for this is here just below the
          up egg position poached eggs are another
          less common order and these eggs are
          made by cooking the egg whites and yolks
          in boiling water the mark propos'd is
          between the scrambled and over-medium
          positions sometimes a customer may not
          want the toast grits or anything else
          other than their eggs these options are
          very easy to mark here I'll mark an

          order over well hold the grits notice

          that I used a nine-inch waffle plate but
          still mark the eggs the same way as if
          it were on a platter this slightly
          smaller plate is a visual reminder that
          the customer doesn't want grits can you
          guess how to mark those same over weigh
          legs on the side that's right you'd use
          the same marker only you'd place it on a
          small plate to remind you that they do
          not want toast or grits finally if a
          customer wants to hold the toast you
          simply place a butter knife on the plate

          these rules for hold the grits hold the
          toast and on the side apply to all egg
          orders including omelets you may have
          asked yourself why I made sure to keep
          the jelly packs vertical when marking
          the egg breakfast that's because if I
          turn the pack horizontally like this it
          means that this is now the mark for an
          omelet there are four positions on the
          plate to mark an omelet ham sausage
          bacon and plain I'm going to show you an
          easy way to remember them a horizontal
          pack in the number one position here at
          the top of the plate represents ham you
          can remember ham is number one because a
          side order of ham comes with one slice a
          packet here on the right side in the
          number two position is a sausage omelet
          - sausage patties come per order and the
          marker is in the number two position the
          number three position is used to mark a
          bacon omelet three strips in an order
          and a mark in the number three position
          the plain position is the only one left
          and it's in the number four position
          here on the left side of the plate
          examples of omelettes that have a mark
          in the number four position could be
          omelets with no meat in them such as
          cheese omelet or a mushroom omelet these
          are marked using a horizontal jelly
          packet in the number four position and a
          piece of the corresponding ingredient
          here you can see a cheese omelet also
          the Fiesta omelet which is indicated by
          a horizontal jelly pack with a right
          side up salad dressing
          pack underneath and a cheese steak

          omelet which is marked with the right
          side up ketchup packet two slices of
          cheese and a jelly pack in the number
          four position
          [Music]

          waffles are our namesake so of course we
          need to learn how to mark them correctly
          a regular waffle is marked using a
          right-side up buttercup on the cooks
          board to mark a pecan waffle simply turn
          the Buttercup over like this chocolate
          chip waffles are another favorite and
          are easy to mark simply mark a regular
          waffle and place a few pieces of
          chocolate chip on top of the marker
          sometimes a customer wants their waffle
          lighter dark so we need to mark them
          accordingly we marked the light and the
          dark waffles the same way we marked the
          light or well scrambled eggs using an
          upside-down Mayo pack for light and a
          right side up Mayo pack for dark looking
          at the pack may help you remember which
          is light and which is dark notice the
          upside down has no text and is lighter
          in color the label side looks darker
          because of the text on it for those
          hungry customers we offer a double
          waffle which is marked by stacking the
          butter cups on top of each other like
          this finally if a sales person calls in
          a waffle to go use it to go syrup packet
          to remind you that it goes in it to go
          play
          [Music]

          now let's talk about our breakfast
          sandwiches just like omelettes these
          sandwiches have the same four positions
          ham sausage bacon and plain to mark a

          sandwich place to pickle slices in the
          appropriate position here you can see I
          put two pickle slices in the number
          three position which tells me this is a
          bacon sandwich if I add a slice of
          cheese to the plate I know this is a
          bacon cheese sandwich to make this a
          bacon egg and cheese sandwich I'll add
          this right side up Mayo packet to the
          right side of the plate
          don't let this Mayo pack confuse you as
          long as you see two pickles on the plate
          you know this is a sandwich when marking
          a sandwich
          this Mayo pack and pickles means a
          sandwich with eggs
          if a customer wanted the eggs on their
          sandwich to be scrambled instead of the
          standard over well egg I'd move this
          Mayo pack down to the bottom of the
          plate to show that the egg is scrambled
          so how would a market if the customer
          wanted an egg and cheese sandwich that's
          right I would put two pickles in the
          plain position to show that there's no
          meat add the slice of cheese and put the
          Mayo pack here on the right side to show
          that the egg is cooked over well what if
          the customer wants to have a sandwich on
          a biscuit or Texas toast the Mart
          remains the same but you must include
          the biscuit or Texas toast to let us

          know the customer doesn't want it served
          on the standard toast the last thing I
          want to cover with sandwiches is the
          mark 4 deluxe sometimes a customer wants
          to add lettuce tomato or grilled onions
          to a sandwich that doesn't automatically
          come with them we call that sandwich
          deluxe let's say that the customer wants
          an egg cheese sandwich with lettuce
          tomato and grilled onions the
          salesperson would call in mark egg
          cheese deluxe and you would mark it with
          two pickles in the plain position a Mayo
          pack to indicate the egg and a slice of
          cheese a leaf of lettuce a slice of
          tomato and a piece of diced onion what

          the customer didn't want the grilled
          onions on this sandwich easy
          the salesperson would call in Mart egg
          cheese deluxe hold the onion and you
          would mark it the same way except you
          would not put the piece of onion on the
          plate many of our customers will want

          bad hashbrowns to these sandwiches so
          let's cover the basic markers for our
          signature waffles hashbrowns to make an
          item a plate which includes hashbrowns
          you simply add a few shreds of
          hashbrowns only platter with the marker
          here I'll mark a bacon egg cheese plate

          if a customer wants a single hash brown
          on the side place a few shreds of hash
          browns on the plate a double hash brown
          goes on a waffle plate and a triple hash
          brown will go on a platter if a customer
          wants ingredients such as onions added
          to the hashbrowns simply add a piece of
          the add-on to the shreds of hashbrowns
          like this
          steamed hash browns are marked by adding
          a butter cup to the shreds of the hash
          browns and a hash brown all the way is
          marked by adding a right-side up
          dressing pack to the shred of hashbrowns
          [Music]

          now that we've covered most of our
          breakfast items let's move on to our
          dinners and major meat sandwiches all
          major meat dinners automatically come
          with hash browns and a piece of grilled
          Texas toast our major meat and egg
          dinners also automatically come with
          hash browns but they include eggs and
          white toast our steak meals require a
          little extra work when marking because
          we will show how well the customer wants
          their steak cooked by where we place the
          marker on the plate t-bone dinner medium
          for instance is marked with the right
          side up buttercup in the middle of the
          plate and a few shreds of hash browns
          how well the steak is cooked increases
          the further up the plates you go so the
          bottom of the plate is rare then up to
          medium rare medium medium-well
          and finally well done you don't have to
          worry about positioning for chicken pork
          chop and country ham as these are always
          cooked well done major meats and eggs
          are marked the same as the corresponding
          dinner
          except you must remember to mark the
          eggs and toast here for example is
          t-bone and eggs well done and over
          medium wheat we just learned that a

          t-bone is marked with the right side up
          buttercup
          but if we flip the Buttercup over we now
          have the mark for a ribeye let's look at
          the mustard Pat the right side up this
          mustard pack represents pork chops while
          upside down we've marked country ham a
          right side up
          ketchup pack is used to mark a sirloin
          dinner
          mayonnaise packs represents a quarter
          pound hamburger when right side up and
          chicken went upside down there are two

          ways that a customer might add some
          great flavor to their dinner or major
          meat and eggs and that is by making them
          southern classic or country classic
          southern classic meals are marked using
          the normal marker and adding an
          upside-down dressing packet
          country classic is easy as all you have
          to do is place a piece of mushroom and
          diced onion with the mark to remind you
          to add onions and mushrooms with the
          meat next I want to talk about our major
          meat sandwiches probably the most common
          major meat sandwich is our quarter pound
          hamburger which we simply call quarter
          quarters and all major meat sandwiches
          come to luxe and should be marked the
          same way we discussed earlier here I'll
          show you how to mark a quarter deluxe
          the marker is a right side up mayo pack
          with lettuce tomato and a piece of onion
          the chicken sandwich is another popular
          menu item simply flip the Mayo pack
          upside down and include deluxe items if

          I switched out the Mayo pack for a
          right-side up mustard pack we would have
          a pork chop sandwich if we turn that
          pack over like this we have the mark for
          a country ham sandwich a ketchup pack
          with deluxe setup lets us know that we
          have a sirloin sandwich customers will
          often want to add bacon to their major
          meat sandwiches if this is the case a
          half order of bacon is included on the
          sandwich and the plate is to be marked
          with a piece of chunked ham to represent
          the bacon here you can see a bacon
          quarter cheese deluxe originals are

          great little burgers with their own
          special way of preparation and marking
          as they are not handled like major meat
          sandwiches an original is marked with a
          single pickle in the center of the plate
          with a piece of onion on top of it if a
          customer wants two patties the mark for
          a double original would include one
          pickle and two pieces of onion like this
          [Music]

          the final items we'll cover today are
          waffles wraps and melts all sandwiches
          can be served as a wrap and are marked
          exactly as they would be for the
          corresponding sandwich you simply add a
          tortilla to the plate here's the mark
          for a sausage egg cheese wrap notice the

          egg marker is in the scramble position
          because all wraps include scrambled eggs
          a melt is a sandwich that is served with
          grilled bread two slices of cheese and
          grilled onions such as a patty Mountain
          breakfast sandwiches can be served as
          melts but they do not include onions to
          mark them out
          simply place the appropriate mark for
          the meat and include the type of bread
          to be grilled in the slices of cheese
          with the mark here I'll mark a Texas
          cheesesteak sandwich with the right side
          up ketchup pack two slices of cheese and
          two pieces of Texas toast well that's
          all for today remember we didn't cover
          every single mark that exists so if you
          are unsure about any of the marks always
          consult the Waffle House Way and always
          wear gloves when handling ready-to-eat
          foods such as many of our markers the
          pull drop mark system is not only
          mandatory here at the Waffle House it is
          also a proven method for reducing stress
          in the restaurant and providing
          consistent delicious food for all of our
          customers

           let's strip down the transcript to its essentials, removing any superfluous explanations and focusing on direct instructions that an employee at Waffle House would need to know for executing the pull-drop-mark system effectively. This distilled guide will present the core of what's necessary in a clear, concise manner.

           for the distillation


           I'd like two eggs over easy with a steamed hash brown and a well done T bone steak.

           Hey can I get a human foot with a side of stainless steel nails and a diet coke?

           I'd like the bacon angus cheeseburger deluxe with a side of hash browns please.
